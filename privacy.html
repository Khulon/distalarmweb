    <h1>Privacy Policy for DistAlarm</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 22, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>DistAlarm</strong> respects your privacy and is committed to being transparent about how your data is used. This policy explains what information may be collected and how it is handled.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>DistAlarm itself does not collect, store, or share any personal data. Your location data is used locally on your device to trigger alarms based on your chosen radius and is never transmitted or stored externally.</p>

    <h2>Advertising and Analytics</h2>
    <p>DistAlarm uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements. AdMob may collect certain information, such as device identifiers, approximate location, and usage data, to deliver ads and measure their performance.</p>
    <p>Depending on your region and preferences, AdMob may show <strong>personalized ads</strong> (based on your interests) or <strong>non-personalized ads</strong> (based only on general context).</p>
    <p>Before showing personalized ads, DistAlarm asks for your consent through a Google-certified Consent Management Platform (CMP), as required under the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> in the UK and the <strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</strong> in California. You can change or withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

    <p>For more information on how Google uses data from its partners, please see 
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services</a>.
    </p>
    <p>You can manage your ad preferences or limit ad tracking in your device’s settings.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to access, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal data. For users in California, you can opt out of the “sale” or “sharing” of personal data for advertising purposes by selecting “Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information” in the consent form presented within the app.</p>

    <h2>We do not:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Collect or store your personal information ourselves</li>
        <li>Track your location in the background unnecessarily</li>
        <li>Sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>DistAlarm uses location services to detect when you enter or exit your chosen area. It also uses notifications and alarm sounds to alert you. These permissions are only active when the app is in use or running a saved alarm.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this policy or your data, please contact us via our 
        <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdIp2SgMbDLgMOlku98vHmGzNQwx1I7YLKz3oJK65ndI7pBgQ/viewform" target="_blank">support form</a>.
