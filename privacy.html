    <h1>Privacy Policy for DistAlarm</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 22, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>DistAlarm</strong> respects your privacy. We are committed to being transparent about what information is collected and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>DistAlarm itself does not collect, store, or share any personal data. Your location data is used only on your device to trigger alarms based on your chosen radius and is never transmitted or stored externally.</p>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>DistAlarm uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to serve ads. AdMob may collect certain information, such as device identifiers, usage data, and approximate location, to provide personalized or non-personalized ads depending on your settings.</p>
    <p>You can manage your ad preferences, including limiting ad tracking, in your device’s settings.</p>

        <li>Sell your data to third parties</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>DistAlarm uses location services to detect when you enter or exit your chosen area. It also uses notifications and alarm sounds to alert you. These permissions are only active when the app is in use or running a saved alarm.</p>
